Voxigine
========

Will eventually be some kind of voxel engine (ala Cube World / Minecraft). I was writing it mostly to get myself familiar with the OpenGL 3+ pipeline, shaders and all, but decided just to go with the oldschool fixed pipeline for now.

#### Planned Features:
* Advanced OpenGL rendering, shaders and stuff, eventually
* Scripted game systems via Lua, hopefully flexible enough to allow creation of any type of game (though if not, it'll likely be RPG-style, with procedurally generated landscapes/dungeons etc.)
